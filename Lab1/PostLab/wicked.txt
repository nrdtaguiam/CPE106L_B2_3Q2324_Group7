Good news!
She's dead!
The Witch of the West is dead!
The wickedest witch there ever was
The enemy of all of us here in Oz
Is Dead!
Good news!
Good news!
Look! It's Glinda!
Let us be glad
Let us be grateful
Let us rejoicify that goodness could subdue
The wicked workings of you-know-who
Isn't it nice to know
That good will conquer evil?
The truth we all believe'll by and by
Outlive a lie
For you and -
No one mourns the Wicked
No one cries "They won't return!"
No one lays a lily on their grave
The good man scorns the Wicked!
Through their lives, our children learn
What we miss, when we misbehave:
And Goodness knows
The Wicked's lives are lonely
Goodness knows
The Wicked die alone
It just shows when you're Wicked
You're left only
On your own
Yes, Goodness knows
The Wicked's lives are lonely
Goodness knows
The Wicked cry alone
Nothing grows for the Wicked
They reap only
What they sow
Are people born Wicked? Or do they have
Wickedness thrust upon them? After all, she had
A father. She had a mother, as so many do:
How I hate to go and leave you lonely
That's alright - it's only just one night
But know that you're here in my heart
While I'm out of your sight
And like every family - they had their secrets
Have another drink, my dark-eyed beauty
I've got one more night left, here in town
So have another drink of green elixir
And we'll have ourselves a little mixer
Have another little swallow, little lady,
And follow me down.
And of course, from the moment she was born,
She was - well - different
It's coming
Now?
The baby's coming
And how!
I see a nose
I see a curl
It's a healthy, perfect,
Lovely, little -
Sweet Oz!
What is it? what's wrong?
How can it be?
What does it mean?
It's atrocious
It's obscene!
Like a froggy, ferny cabbage
The baby is unnaturally
Green!
Take it away, take it away!
So you see - it couldn't have been easy!
No one mourns the Wicked!
Now at last, she's dead and gone!
Now at last, there's joy throughout the land
And Goodness knows
We know what Goodness is
Goodness knows
The Wicked die alone
She died alone
Woe to those (Woe to those)
Who spurn what Goodnesses
They are shown
No one mourns the Wicked
Good news!
No one mourns the Wicked!
Good news!
No one mourns the Wicked!
Wicked!
Wicked!
